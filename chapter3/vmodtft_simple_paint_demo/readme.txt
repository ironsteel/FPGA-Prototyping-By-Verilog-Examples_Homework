Simple Paint is a demo project for the VmodTFT board. It continuously samples the touch panel for X, Y and pressure values and lights up the pixels touched. Pixel brightness changes according to the touch pressure. Since the BRAM resources are limited for the frame buffer, no color information is stored. Instead, the screen is divided into 3 sections: red, green and blue.
Two variants of this project are provided: one for the Atlys board, the other for the Nexys3. The only difference is that the Nexys3 displays touch readings on the seven-segment display, while on the Atlys, this is done on the LEDs.
Switches<2:0> control the backlight intensity. Switch<3> is an on/off switch for the display. The project implements the proper power-up and power-down sequence required by the LCD on the VmodTFT.
